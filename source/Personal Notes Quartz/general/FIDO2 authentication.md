The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance helps to promote open authentication standards and **reduce the use of passwords as a form of authentication**. FIDO2 is the latest standard that incorporates the web authentication ([[WebAuthn]]) standard.

Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an **open standard for #passwordless authentication**.

These **FIDO2 security keys are typically USB devices** but could also use Bluetooth or NFC. With a hardware device that handles the authentication, the security of an account is increased as there's no password that could be exposed or guessed.
