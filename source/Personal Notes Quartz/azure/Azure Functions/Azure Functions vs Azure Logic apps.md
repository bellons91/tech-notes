Both [[Azure Functions]] and [[azure-logic-apps]] are Azure Services that enable serverless workloads.

Azure Functions is a serverless **compute service**, whereas Azure Logic Apps is a serverless **workflow integration platform**.

Both can create complex **orchestrations**. For Azure Functions you develop orchestrations by writing code that use the [[Azure Durable Functions]] extension.

For Logic Apps, you use the GUI or edit the configuration files to orchestrate Actions.
