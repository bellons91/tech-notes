Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group.

A Resource Group can contain one or more resources, but a resource can belong to only one Resource group.

Resource groups **cannot be nested**.

When you apply an action (eg: delete, change permissions) to a resource group, that action will apply to all the resources within the resource group.
