Azure Blob Storage is a generic storage solution. You can store **text and binary data** in an unstructured format.

Blob storage can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads.

Blob storage is ideal for:

- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

Objects can be accessed via HTTP or HTTPS, given that every object can be referenced using a specific URL.

**An [[azure-storage-account-scripts]] is the top-level container** for all of your Azure Blob storage. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data.

This service provides a list of endpoints available at https://{storage-account-name}.blob.core.windows.net

Each Storage Account contains one or more [[Azure Blob Container]], and each Blob Container contains

Depending on the usage, you can use a different [[Blob Storage Tiers]].

You can enable **[[versioning for blobs]]** (keep all the versions or remove versions older than X days). For blobs you can store each single version (each representing an update), an one or more **snapshots**, that are "named" versions for easier retrieval.

You can enable [[blob change feeds]].

You can create [[immutable blobs]] using predefined rules or defining custom policies.

## Types of Blobs

The storage service offers three types of blobs: [[Block Blobs]], [[Append Blobs]], and [[Page Blobs]]. You specify the blob type when you create the blob. Once the blob has been created, its type cannot be changed.

All blobs reflect committed changes immediately. Each version of the blob has a unique tag, called an #ETag, that you can use with access conditions to assure you only change a specific instance of the blob.

Any blob can be **leased for exclusive write access**. When a blob is leased, only calls that include the current lease ID can modify the blob or (for block blobs) its blocks.

## Security

All data (including metadata) written to Azure Storage is automatically encrypted using Storage Service Encryption ( #SSE ). Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit [[AES encryption]]. Azure Storage encryption is enabled for all new and existing storage accounts and **can't be disabled**.

All Azure Storage resources are encrypted, including blobs, disks, files, queues, and tables. All object metadata is also encrypted. **Storage accounts are encrypted regardless of their performance tier** (standard or premium).

Also, [[Azure Role-Based Access Control]] is available for both data and management operations, like using #RBAC roles to manage access to resources and configurations, and using Microsoft Entra to handle access to blob and queue data operations.

You can **assign RBAC roles scoped to a subscription, resource group, storage account, or an individual container or queue** to a security principal or a managed identity for Azure resources.

**Data in transit between an application and Azure can be secured** by using Client-Side Encryption, HTTPS, or [[Server Message Block protocol]] 3.0.

**OS and data disks used by Azure virtual machines can be encrypted** using Azure Disk Encryption.

Encryption relies on keys. You have three options to handle keys:

1. let Microsoft manage and generate keys;
2. create **customer-managed keys** to encrypt and decrypt all data in the storage account. A customer-managed key is used to encrypt all data in all services in your storage account.
3. use a **customer-provided key** on Blob storage operations. A client making a read or write request against Blob storage can include an encryption key on the request for granular control over how blob data is encrypted and decrypted.

## How to operate with Azure Blob Storage using REST APIs

You can use the CLI, .NET SDKs, or REST APIs to work with Blob Storage.

You can define properties (system-wide) and blob-specific [[Azure Block Blobs metadata]].

For REST APIs,the metadata consists of name/value pairs. The total size of all metadata pairs can be up to 8KB in size. Metadata are stored as HTTP headers: you can retrieve them by using both the GET and the HEAD HTTP verb.

```bash
GET/HEAD https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=metadata
```

You can set metadata by using the PUT method. **If you don't set any metadata, the operation clears all the existing ones**.

```bash
PUT https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?comp=metadata&restype=container
```
