A stored access policy provides an extra level of control over service-level [[Shared Access Signatures]] on the server side.

With stored access policy you can group [[SAS]] and provides more restrictions for signatures that bound by the policy.

You can use a stored access policy to change the start time, expiry time, or permissions for a signature, or to revoke it after it is issued.

Stored Access Policies are supported by [[Blob containers]], [[File shares]], [[Queues]], [[Tables]].

To create or modify a stored access policy, call the Set #ACL operation for the resource (see Set Container ACL, Set Queue ACL, Set Table ACL, or Set Share ACL) with a request body that specifies the terms of the access policy. The body of the request includes a unique signed identifier of your choosing, up to 64 characters in length, and the optional parameters of the access policy.

```cs
BlobSignedIdentifier identifier = new BlobSignedIdentifier
{
    Id = "stored access policy identifier",
    AccessPolicy = new BlobAccessPolicy
    {
        ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
        Permissions = "rw"
    }
};

blobContainer.SetAccessPolicy(permissions: new BlobSignedIdentifier[] { identifier });
```
