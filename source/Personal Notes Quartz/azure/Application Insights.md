Application Insights can monitor applications running in Azure, on-premises, or in a different cloud environment.

You can either **install an SDK** in your application, or you can **use the Application Insights agent**.

It can track several pieces of information, like:

- Request rates, response times, and failure rates
- Dependency rates, response times, and failure rates to show whether external services are slowing down performance
- Page views and load performance reported by users' browsers
- AJAX calls from web pages, including rates, response times, and failure rates
- User and session counts
- Performance counters from Windows or Linux server machines, such as CPU, memory, and network usage
