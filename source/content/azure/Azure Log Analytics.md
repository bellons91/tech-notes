Azure Log Analytics is the tool in the Azure portal where you'll write and run **log queries** on the data gathered by [[Azure Monitor]].

You can write an advanced query to perform statistical analysis and visualize the results in a chart to identify a particular trend.

Whether you work with the results of your queries interactively or use them with other Azure Monitor features such as log query alerts or workbooks, Log Analytics is the tool to use to write and test those queries.
