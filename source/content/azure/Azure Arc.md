Azure Arc allows you to extend your compliance and monitoring to your hybrid and multi-cloud configurations, in particular when using [[Azure Resource Manager]].

Azure Arc provides a **centralized, unified way** to:

- Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure resources into ARM.
- Manage multi-cloud and hybrid virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if running in Azure.
- Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities.

It can work with a specific set of services:

- Servers
- Kubernetes clusters
- SQL Servers
- Azure data services
- Virtual machines
