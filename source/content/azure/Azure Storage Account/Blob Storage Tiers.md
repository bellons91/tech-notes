To manage [[Azure Blob Storage]] costs better, you have to pick the right storage tier, depending on the expected usage.

The following considerations apply to the different access tiers:

- The access tier can be set on a blob during or after upload.
- **Only the hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level**. The archive access tier can only be set at the blob level.
- Data in the cool access tier has slightly lower availability, but still has high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput characteristics similar to hot data.
- **Data in the archive access tier is stored offline**. The archive tier offers the lowest storage costs but also the highest access costs and latency.
- **The hot and cool tiers support all [[Azure Storage Redundancy Types]] options**. The archive tier supports only LRS, GRS, and RA-GRS.
- **Data storage limits are set at the account level and not per access tier**. You can choose to use all of your limit in one tier or across all three tiers.

## Hot tier

New storage accounts are created in the **hot tier by default**.

In the Hot tier, you keep your resources always available: it's **good for data that is accessed often** because it allows you to access it quickly.

**Costs are high for the storage** because you need to store the data in an optimized way, but **low for data access** because the data retrieval is optimized for reads.

Some considerations:

- can be set at account level;
- can be set at blob level, during or after the upload;

## Cool tier

Data is stored in a way that is optimal for long-term data storage but whose access is not optimized.

Costs are low for storage but high for data access.

This tier is good **for data that is accessed infrequently** and that does not change for at least 30 days.

Some considerations:

- can be set at account level;
- can be set at blob level, during or after the upload;
- has lower #SLA for availability, but higher SLA for durability, latency, and thoughput.

## Cold tier

Data is stored in a way that is optimal for long-term data storage but whose access is not optimized.

This tier is good **for data that is accessed infrequently** and that does not change for at least 90 days.

Some considerations:

- can be set at account level;
- can be set at blob level, during or after the upload;
- has lower SLA for availability, but higher SLA for durability, latency, and thoughput.

## Archive tier

This tier is for archiving data, so its costs are **very high for data access** and **very low for data storage**.

It's good for data that does not change for at least 180 days.

Data is stored offline to reduce costs, but you will have higher costs to rehydrate and access data.

The archive tier is available only for individual [[Block Blobs]]. This tier is optimized for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency.

### Rehydration of archived blobs

Once a blob is in the Archive tier, it's considered to be offline, and cannot be read or modified. To reuse it, you have to **rehydrate** it.

You have two ways:

1. copy the blob to an online tier (either hot or cool).
2. use the Set Blob Tier operation to change the blob's tier to hot or cool.

Rehydrating a blob can take several hours, depending on the size of the blob. Microsoft recommends rehydrating larger blobs for optimal performance. Rehydrating several small blobs concurrently might require extra time.

You can define the priority of the rehydration of a blob by setting the `x-ms-rehydrate-priority` header in the Set Blob Tier or the Copy Blob operation. It has two values:

- Standard: blobs are rehydrated following the order of requests. It may take 15 hours;
- High: prioritizes the rehydration. Ideal for blobs of less than 10 GB in size. It can take 1 our to rehydrate the blob.

Since you cannot copy a blob to the same location maintaining the same name, when you have to copy a blob to rehydrate it you have to either change its name or choose another containter.

Copying an archived blob to an online destination tier is supported within the same storage account only. You can't copy an archived blob to a destination blob that is also in the archive tier.

An alternative to copying the blob is to change it's access tier, using the Set Blob Tier command. However, this operation does not change the last modified time, so a [[Azure Blob Storage lifecycle]] policy may move it back to the Archive tier.
