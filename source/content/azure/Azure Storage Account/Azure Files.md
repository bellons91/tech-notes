It's a fully managed solution to share files in the cloud using standard protocols, such as [[Server Message Block protocol]] (accessible from Windows, Linux, and macOS clients) or [[Network File System (NFS)]] (accessible from Linux and macOS clients).

Given that SMB and NFS are industry standards, you can replace your current file share with the one hosted on Azure.

You can create file shares using Azure CLI and PowerShell commands.

Files can be accessed using Azure Portal or Azure Storage Explorer.

Azure files support high availability.

This service provides a list of endpoints available at https://{storage-account-name}.file.core.windows.net
