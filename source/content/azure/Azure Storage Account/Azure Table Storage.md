Azure Tables can be used to store large amounts of **structured data**.

Azure tables are a #NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud.

Ideal for structured, non-relational data.

This service provides a list of endpoints available at https://{storage-account-name}.table.core.windows.net

Now these tables can be used in [[Azure Cosmos DB]].
