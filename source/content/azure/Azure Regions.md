A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains one or more datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.

Some features are only available in certain regions.

Some other services are not bound to a specific region because they are worldwide; examples are [[Azure Entra|Active Directory]], [[Azure DNS]], and [[Azure Traffic Manager]].
