Azure DevTest Labs is a tool to create and manage [[Infrastructure-as-a-Service]] (like [[Azure Virtual Machines]]) and [[paas]] (like [[Azure App Service]]) instances for dev and test environments.

Lab owners can create preconfigured VMs that have tools and software lab users need. Lab users can claim preconfigured VMs, or create and configure their own VMs and environments. Lab policies and other methods track and control lab usage and costs.

Labs can be created by using templates such as [[Azure Resource Manager]].

Common scenarios are:

- dev/test environments;
- training labs;
