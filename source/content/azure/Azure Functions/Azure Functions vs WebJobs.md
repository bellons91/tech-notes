Both [[Azure Functions]] and [[Azure App Service WebJobs]] are built on top of [[Azure App Service]].

They both support integrations with [[Application Insights]].

**Azure Functions is built on the WebJobs SDK**, so it shares many of the same event triggers and connections to other Azure services.

Azure Functions offers more developer productivity than Azure App Service WebJobs does. It also offers more options for programming languages, development environments, Azure service integration, and pricing.
