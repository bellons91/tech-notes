Azure Monitor is a platform for collecting data on your resources, analyzing that data, visualizing the information, and even acting on the results.

Azure Monitor can monitor **Azure** resources, your **on-premises** resources, and even **multi-cloud** resources like virtual machines hosted with a different cloud provider.

You can receive logs from several sources, such as a server application, and then store them in a repository that will be used to analyze the data.
