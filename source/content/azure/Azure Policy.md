Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources.

Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as **initiatives**.

Azure Policy evaluates your resources and **highlights resources that aren't compliant with the policies you've created**. Azure Policy can also prevent non-compliant resources from being created by automatically applying rules. If you don't want rules to be applied to some resources, you can mark such resources as _exceptions_.

Azure Policy has built-in policy and initiative definitions for Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring.
