Azure Monitor Alerts are an automated way to stay informed when [[Azure Monitor]] detects a threshold being crossed.

Depending on your configuration, Azure Monitor Alerts can also attempt **corrective action**.

Alerts can be set up to monitor the logs and trigger certain log events, or they can be set to monitor metrics and trigger when certain metrics are crossed. Rules can be based on logs to allow for complex logic across data from multiple sources.
