With the _cmdlets_, you can call the Azure REST API to perform management tasks in Azure.

Cmdlets can be combined to orchestrate actions.

Examples are:

- The routine setup, teardown, and **maintenance** of a single resource or multiple connected resources.
- The **deployment of an entire infrastructure**, which might contain dozens or hundreds of resources from imperative code.

It's available via [[Azure Cloud Shell]], and it can be installed locally on Windows, Linux, and Mac machines.

It uses PowerShell commands.
