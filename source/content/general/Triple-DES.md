Triple-des is a symmetric-key #encryption algorithm that uses three 56-bit keys to encrypt and decrypt data.

It is a variant of the Data Encryption Standard ([[DES]]) that was developed in the 1970s. Triple-des applies DES three times to each data block, making it more secure than single DES, but also slower.

Triple-des is widely used in banking, e-commerce, and other applications that require high-level security.
