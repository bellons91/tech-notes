A PFX file is a type of [[Certificate]] file that contains both the public and private keys of a digital signature.

It is used to verify the identity of the [[certificate holder]] and to create secure connections with web servers, email servers, or other applications.

A PFX file can be generated from other certificate formats, such as .pvk, .spc, or .cer, using tools like Pvk2Pfx or Advanced Installer. 

A PFX file is password protected and can be imported or exported to different devices or platforms.
