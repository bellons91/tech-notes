The principle of least privilege says that **you should only grant access up to the level needed to complete a task**.

Suppose you only need read access to a resource. In that case, you should only be granted access to that specific resource and only for read operations.

In Azure, this can be achieved using [[Azure Role-Based Access Control]].
